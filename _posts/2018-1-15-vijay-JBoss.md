## JBoss:

JBOSS Community is an organization participating in Google Code-in. JBoss Community is a open source community. It is a non profit organization. To know more about JBoss just go to this link: https://gci.jboss-outreach.org/ . 
To join the JBOSS channel and chat with the mentors and contributors go to this link: https://gitter.im/jboss-outreach/gci.

## Experience with JBoss :
 I was introduced to GCI by my friend. My whole aim was to get a t-shirt. And I joined late to GCI nearly at the ending of GCI contest so I was searching for easy tasks.
 I found a very easy and a 2 mins task at JBoss community. I did it and completed successfully. And my friend told me to complete tasks in only one community so that you will have a chance to emerge as a finalist.
 So I started doing tasks in JBoss. After completing 3 tasks I joined to their gitter channel. I worked with people whom I don't know. That gave me a wonderful experience.
 "JBoss is the Big Boss",
 I framed this quote for JBoss and it suits well. The members in JBoss community encouraged me. Now I have successfully completed 11 tasks.
 Working with JBoss community is like being in heaven with gods as equals. I was stunned with their website creation. It was wonderful.
 Working with Great coders gave me a wonderful experience. I will not stop working JBoss and One day I will become a mentor in JBoss Community.
 Thanks JBoss for the golden memories. I will not forget JBoss community. I learnt many things while working with JBoss. Mentors worked 24 hours in a day.
 I have irritated many friends to help me. I apologize to you. I think I contributed some things for JBoss Community." Soon you will see me as a Mentor ".
