JBOSS :

JBOSS Community is an organization participating in Google code-in. My first task I did with JBOSS Community. It was looking very easy. I wanted to get just a shirt. But when I came to JBOSS Community I was encouraged by the mentors and my friends in the Gitter Channel. I think JBOSS's website creation is the best in the world... Their working on a great project like the compressor head project.
"JBOSS is the Big BOSS "

Google Code-In (2017-2018) :

This contest will attract many students to participate in it as they award a shirt for completing just three tasks. Most of them participate in it to get a t-shirt. I learnt a lot from this contest. I learnt gtk in one day. That was a big achievement to me. My mentors were very kind to me. @Murad was the mentor who approved me for all the tasks. Every mentor in JBOSS Community was working all nights and days. This is a good contest as every teens get to learn about coding, designing and many other things. I learnt designing and coding. If I don't win also I will not cry because I got a great community to contribute and to work with them. I am a 14 year old app developer. I guess I learnt many things to improve my app. Google is keeping the world engaged with their contests through out the year. This will be a great opportunity for many teens. This will recognize the great and superb coders in the world and give them awards which will encourage them. The feeling you get when you win a t-shirt from google can't be compare to anything in the world. Thanks for the memories and Thank you Google for the wonderful experience.

Apologies :

 I apologize to my friends especially @sidhyatikku for annoying them..Sorry ...
